// export const WHO_TEXT = "Hi! I'm Rachael Rosenberg, I'm 14 and the Founder of Bundles of Kindness. In December, 2018, I created a community project to help the homeless of Los Angeles – everywhere from Canoga Park to Beverly Hills. With the help of many large companies, small businesses, non profit organizations and individuals, I have been able to help bring, kindness, dignity and most importantly, necessities to the homeless of Los Angeles. For many years I have seen homeless men, women and families throughout Los Angeles. At first, I would give people snacks from the car as my family and I drove around town. Then I volunteered to make sandwiches at my synagogue for people in need. Then my sisters and I put together a few meals from our family kitchen to give to people on the streets. That was good, but not good enough. I decided I wanted to take things into my own hands because not enough was being done to help the homeless. By this time it was 2018 and I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah. It is customary for kids preparing for their Bat/Bar Mitzvahs to donate time volunteering in the community. I explored the possibility of volunteering with an existing organization, but decided after exploring some options that what I really wanted to do was create my own project so that I could dedicate as much time as possible to helping the homeless. Fast forward – my Bat Mitzvah took place in September, 2019, at which time I announced that Round 2 of Bundles of Kindness was underway! As Ed Asner said, “ No one, nowhere, at no time should go hungry.” I am determined to make a difference. As Margaret Mead said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”";
